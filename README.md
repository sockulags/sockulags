### About me
In January 2023, I kicked off my journey into development. Before making the leap, I balanced life as an athlete and personal trainer. Prior to that I got a bachelors degree in industrial economics.
When I started this journey it quickly became clear that coding is my calling. I'm eager to learn and proficient in both C# and JavaScript. Looking ahead, I'm open to opportunities in backend development using C#.NET or frontend work with React. If you have a fitting role, I'm all ears. Let's chat!
