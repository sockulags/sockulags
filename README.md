### About me
In January 2023, I kicked off my journey into development. Before making the leap, I balanced life as an athlete and personal trainer. Prior to that I got a bachelors degree in industrial economics.
When I started this journey it quickly became clear that coding is my calling. I'm eager to learn and proficient in both C# and JavaScript. Looking ahead, I'm open to opportunities in backend development using C#.NET or frontend work with React. If you have a fitting role, I'm all ears. Let's chat!




### Repositories
My bigger projects is highlighted directly under Projects below\
**Code Cave** is a blog where it is simple to make new post including direct formatting for code snippets\
**Base Programming** is a re-used name from when I used to write training programs. It is a library for exercises, for when you need inspiration.\
**PlÃ¥nkan App** Budget tracker using graph for nice visualisation. Has a export function where you can get you income and expense history, also in beautiful graphs.\
**Klossus Kolossus** A Tetris-game made in Unity and as a final projet during my C#.NET bootcamp in the beginning of 2023. The unique thing about it that it has a co-op mode, where you play tetris with a friend, both trying to clear to rows together.
